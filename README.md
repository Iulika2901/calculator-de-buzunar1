<h1>Pocket Calculator with LED Display</h1>

<p>This repository contains a VHDL project for a pocket calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The results of the operations are displayed on an 8-digit LED display.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Addition:</strong> The addition functionality is implemented in VHDL and allows the user to add two numbers of up to 8 bits each.</li>
  <li><strong>Subtraction:</strong> The subtraction operation is implemented and can subtract a number of up to 8 bits from another number of up to 8 bits.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiplication:</strong> The multiplication module allows multiplying two numbers of up to 8 bits each and displays the result on an 8-digit LED display.</li>
  <li><strong>Division:</strong> The division function can divide a number of up to 8 bits by another number of up to 8 bits and displays the result on the LED display.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pocket Calculators:</strong> This VHDL implementation can be used to develop pocket calculators or other portable devices that require basic mathematical functions.</li>
  <li><strong>Electronics Projects:</strong> The project can be integrated into other electronics projects or more complex devices that require mathematical calculation functions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong> Implement a user interface to allow users to interact with the calculator using buttons or touch inputs.</li>
  <li><strong>Additional Operations:</strong> Add support for additional mathematical operations such as square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimization for Resource Usage:</strong> Optimize the VHDL code for better resource usage and performance on FPGA devices.</li>
</ul>
